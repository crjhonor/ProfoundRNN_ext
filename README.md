## TODO: Go deeper into the dicinger theory
Forecasting lower probability simulating dicing a dice is implemented by myself previously and proved to be very useful,
specially while I tried to forecast future data using ht given timeseries. Repeatedly fitting and predicting the 
correlated dataset with different models will generate odds every single day and can be used to forecast a probability
I believed should related to the one times ahead.

## TODO: Two ways to imporve
- One, extend the dimensions of the dataset with the significant correlations. With more powerful device of deep learning, 
try to calculate more data I can get.
- Two, extend the number of models with different technics.

# Folders Instructions

- /scripts # storing the main scripts
- /models # stroring models
- /utils # storing utility scripts such as preprocessing and reading dataset, etc.
